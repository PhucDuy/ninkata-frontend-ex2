## Frontend Exercise 2

Well done on ex1, in this 2nd ex, you will learn about how to build a frontend pages/site with ajax using modern toolchains.

### Research

* Research and install [http://yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io)
* Research about ajax:
  * How ajax work
  * How to implement ajax with/without jQuery

### Requirement

We will build a movies portal using [Rotten Tomatoes](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs)' database.
The page you build will have:
  * An input box to search for movies
  * Request will be made if the input field have more than 3 character AND user stop input for 500ms
  * Each request will only fetch 3 results per page.
  * A table to show the searching result with **infinite scrolling**, simple table, need not to make it beautiful. Try to have as much information as [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/movies-in-theaters/?ref_=nv_mv_inth_1)
  * When click on a row of that table, there will be an popup show that movies's review.
  * Try to care about the naming convention of css/html/js

### Instruction

  1. Install yeoman
